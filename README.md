# Funkin FLPs
 FLPs for FNF songs i've managed to snag go here lol!!

Each FLP gets it's own readme, which outlines details like:

*Who originally made it

*Who recreated it (if applicable)

*Required plugins

*Any issues with the FLP such as missing samples or having paid plugins

*A link to the official release of the song which you should click to support the original composer

*The mod from which the song originated


If a song you've made is up here and you want it taken down, please contact me on discord at Aurazona#1337.
