# Funkin FLPs
 FLPs for FNF songs i've managed to snag go here lol!!

Each FLP gets it's own readme, which outlines details like:
*Who originally made it
*Who recreated it (if applicable)
*Required plugins
*Any issues with the FLP such as missing samples or having paid plugins
*A link to the official release of the song which you should click to support the original composer
*The mod from which the song originated
